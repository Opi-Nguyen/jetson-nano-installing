## 3. Initial Setup & Booting Jetson Nano

### 3.1. Identify TTY Device
Before connecting Jetson Nano to a Linux computer, check the existing serial devices using:
```bash
dmesg | grep --color 'tty'
```
Then, connect the Jetson Nano to the computer via the Micro-USB port and run the command again to identify the newly added device. Example output:
```
[xxxxxx.xxxxxx] cdc_acm 1-5:1.2: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
```
The newly detected device is `/dev/ttyACM0`. Verify with:
```bash
ls -l /dev/ttyACM0
```
Example output:
```
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Oct  2 02:45 /dev/ttyACM0
```

### 3.2. Connect to Serial Console using `screen`
If `screen` is not installed, install it using:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y screen
```
Then, connect to Jetson Nano using:
```bash
sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

### 3.3. Exit `screen`
To exit the `screen` session, press **Ctrl + A**, then **K**, and confirm with **Y**.

### 3.4. Complete the Setup
Once connected to Jetson Nano, press **SPACE** if the initial setup screen does not appear automatically.
